# How to use

![Example image](https://github.com/gieoon/Hide-Youtube-Views/blob/master/example.png)

I'm publishing this on the Chrome Extension store. But until then,
1. Either `$ git clone https://github.com/gieoon/Hide-Youtube-Views.git` or zip the git repository and add it somewhere.
2. Go to your the Extensions in your Chrome browser [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Click __Load unpacked__
4. Navigate to where you cloned the repository.

I'm working on moving this to the Desktop.

# Why make this?
 
1. Because it's easy (Just CSS stuff).
2. Because views and likes can be distracting. It takes a bit to get used to, but it can be quite an interesting experience.

# What is going to be adding next?

1. Ability to guess the number of views on a video (Useful for learning about marketing)
